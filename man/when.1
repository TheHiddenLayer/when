NAME
       when - A utility that translates timestamps into something friendly and human-readable

SYNOPSIS
       when [-v] <timestamp>

DESCRIPTION
       The when utility parses and describes timestamps from various
       formats, such as the RFC and Unix timestamps. It then generates a
       human-readable description of the provided timestamp, indicating
       whether the timestamp in the past or future and providing a sense
       of approximation. This utility obviously enhances any application
       where timestamped data is frequently displayed to users.

OPTIONS
       -v
           Enable verbose mode to display wordy output.

EXAMPLES
       To parse and describe a timestamp:

           when 2023-09-01T14:30:00Z
           when 1630493400

       To parse and verbosely describe a timestamp:

           when -v 2023-09-01T14:30:00Z
           when -v 1630493400
